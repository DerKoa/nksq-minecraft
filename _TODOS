4 - Playbook for the server itself so it creates backups on it's own (serer stop, backup creating, server start) with a daily cron and a cleanup after a number of backups

5 - Define a list with plugins to use those instead of static links

6 - Extend backup playbook so it updates the server automaically (should I really do this?)

7 - EssentialsXDiscord - how does it work?

8 - Simplify plugins playbook (move all plugins at once e.g.)

9 - BUG - Not possible to initial install java since it needs an interactive shell

10 - Remove archive usage for faster progressing of the playbook and better overview
